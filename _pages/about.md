Hello!
I'm Yoyo, a 4th year undergraduate in math at Johns Hopkins University.
I am still developing my math interests ---
right now I particularly enjoy learning about
algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and category theory.
I used to organize the 
[math club and undergrad seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/jhu-mathclub/)
at JHU.

Outside of math, I am an amateur [flutist](/music).
Here is a [recording](files/reinecke.mp3) of my performance of
the first movement of Reinecke's concerto with the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra
as one of the winners of the concerto competition in spring 2022.

Here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf).
