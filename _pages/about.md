Hello!
I'm Yoyo, and I am currently studying the Part III mathematics course
at the University of Cambridge.
I am still developing my math interests ---
right now I particularly enjoy learning about
algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and category theory.
I used to organize the 
[math club and undergrad seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/jhu-mathclub/)
at JHU.

Outside of math, I am an [amateur](https://www.etymonline.com/word/amateur) [flautist](/music).
In the 2025-26 academic year, I am performing with the
[Cambridge University Orchestra](https://www.cmp.cam.ac.uk/opportunities/entry/cambridge-university-orchestra/)
as principal flute (upcoming [concerts](https://www.cmp.cam.ac.uk/events/ensemble/cambridge-university-orchestra-cuo/)),
as well as with my woodwind quartet *Senza Corno* as a part of
the [Instrumental Award Scheme](https://www.cmp.cam.ac.uk/opportunities/entry/ias/) at Cambridge.
During my undergrad, I frequently performend with the [Hopkins Symphony Orchestra](https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/hso/);
here is a [recording](files/reinecke.mp3) of my performance of
the first movement of Reinecke's concerto with the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra
as one of the winners of the concerto competition in spring 2022.

Here is my [CV](files/cv.pdf).
