I am currently studying with
[Giorgio Consolati](https://www.giorgioconsolati.eu/).
Previous teachers include
[Christian Paquette](https://christianpaquette.com/) and
Laura Chambers.

I love playing chamber music -- please reach out
if you want to play together! I am always
down to sightread violin parts but bonus points
if you find something written for the flute
([one](https://imslp.org/wiki/18_Canons_M%C3%A9lodieux,_TWV_40:118-123_(Telemann,_Georg_Philipp))
of my favourite duets to sightread).
