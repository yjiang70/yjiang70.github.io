In summer 2024, I participated in the [REU at UChicago](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2024/)
under the mentorship of [Peter May](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/), where I read about
model categories, enriched categories, and \\((\infty,1)\\)-categories with a focus
on understanding homotopy limits and colimits.
I extended this reading project into a (expository) senior thesis
advised by [Emily Riehl](https://emilyriehl.github.io/).
[Here](files/ug-thesis-draft) is a *very rough* draft, likely riddled with typos and mistakes.
Read at your own peril!

In summer 2023, I participated in the
[Research Opportunities in Mathematics for Underrepresented Students (ROMUS)](https://math.osu.edu/research/undergraduate) 
program at The Ohio State University under the supervision of
[David Penneys](https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/),
where I worked on a project, mentored by [Sean Sanford](https://seancs.page/index.html)
and [David Green](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/green.2116/),
to classify braidings over non-split Tambara-Yamagami categories over the reals.
Here is our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21012)
and here are some [slides](/files/braidings-on-non-split-ty-matrx.pdf) on preliminary results.
