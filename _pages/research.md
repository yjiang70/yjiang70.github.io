In summer 2024 I participated in the [REU at UChicago](https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2024/)
under the mentorship of Prof. [Peter May](https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/), where I read about
model categories, enriched categories, and \\((\infty,1)\\)-categories with a focus
on understanding homotopy limits and colimits.
I am extending this reading project into a senior thesis on stable infinity categories
advised by [Emily Riehl](https://emilyriehl.github.io/)
and [Rok Gregoric](https://sites.google.com/view/rokgregoric/home).

I am also working on a project with [Sean Sanford](https://seancs.page/index.html)
and [David Green](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/green.2116/)
to classify braidings over non-split Tambara-Yamagami categories over the reals,
which started in summer 2023 at the [Research Opportunities in Mathematics for Underrepresented Students (ROMUS)](https://math.osu.edu/research/undergraduate) program at The Ohio State University under the supervision of
[David Penneys](https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/).
Here are some [slides](/files/braidings-on-non-split-ty-matrx.pdf) on preliminary results.
